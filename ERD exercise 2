Create COMPANY database ERD to illustrate the concepts of Entity Relationship Model. 
This database will contain the information about employees, departments and projects:

There are several departments in the company. 
Each department has an unique identification, a name, location of the office and a particular employee who manages the department.
A department controls a number of projects, each of which has unique name, a unique number and the budget.
Each employee has name, an identification number, address, salary, birthdate. 
An employee is assigned to one department but can join in several projects. 
We need to record the start date of the employee in each project. We also need to know the direct supervisor of each employee.
We want to keep track of the dependents of the employees. Each dependent has name, birthdate and relationship with the employee.
